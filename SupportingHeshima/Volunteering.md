# Volunteering with Heshima

## Things you can do!

We always need help at Heshima and thankfully people both old and young, from around the world, volunteer to help out. Some volunteer for a couple of weeks, whilst others commit to a longer period of time … but all are useful!  We try to find out where your strengths and interests lie and then we match you up with something you feel comfortable with. Recently these are some of the jobs that our volunteers have taken on:

* Organise activities for the mother and toddler group.
* Teach English to Maasai women.
* Support students with reading at the Saturday School.
* Developed the Garden.
* Built an obstacle course for Children.
* Helped with the building work including painting, carpentry, plumbing and electrics.
* Run some art, music or drama workshops.
* Coached football
* Delivered training at the textile training centre.
* Wrote newsletters.
* Organised or participated in a sponsored event eg. climbing Kilimanjaro.
* Let us know what you are interested in and I am sure that we will be able to make the most of your skills and gifts.

## Cost of Volunteering

You will need to buy your return flight. Our nearest airport is Kilimanjaro, but many of our volunteers have found it cheaper to fly to Nairobi airport. There are buses that run from the airport to Arusha and once we know your arrival time we can book you on this bus. (Around £20.00 for the bus ticket).

We can arrange accommodation for you on the Braeburn school site, which is around 5 km away from the Heshima site. Accommodation here is around £6 a night for a room. Two people can stay together in one room. The room is basic but clean and includes a mosquito net, and an ensuite shower room. In the courtyard behind your room there is a shared kitchen and dining area, where you can cook your meals.

There is an outdoor swimming pool, bar, basketball court and squash courts on the school site, which all our volunteers can use.

Please remember that there is no National Health service in Tanzania and so all our volunteers need to come with medical insurance. The Tanzanian Government also requires you to come with a yellow fever certificate. If you forget it, you may be given the injection at the airport for $20.00!

## Things to do and see

There are many things to do and see in and around Arusha. Of course, you can’t really come all this way and not go to one of our near by National Parks. We can help you to arrange a day trip to one of the parks listed below:

* Arusha National Park
* Tarangire National Park
* Manyara National Park

The entrance charge for each of these parks at present is $35 per person and it will cost around $200 for a safari vehicle, fuel and a driver.

Two world famous parks, around a 4 hour drive away are:

* The Ngorogoro Crater
* Serengeti National Park
* We can help you to arrange an overnight trip to these parks but if you are wanting to do this please set aside around £400.

Most of our volunteers choose to work for 5 days a week and have two days off. There are lots of things to see locally including:

* The Maasai Market
* The Snake Park
* The Old Fort Museum
* Lake Duluti

There are also lots of lovely places to enjoy a meal.

Some of our volunteers choose to visit the beach in their last week, before going home. If you would like us to help you arrange your accommodation and transport, please let us know. A simple ensuite banda on our nearest beach (Pangani) costs around £30.00 per person a night for bed and breakfast.
