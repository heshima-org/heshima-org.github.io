# Heshima Preschool

The preschool class has evolved over the years, from running only on Wednesday mornings with Fina to now having 2 classes with qualified teachers.We have built up the playground and buildings with help and donations from volunteers and different school groups visits.

Any donations for the preschool are always welcome plus volunteers who would like to work with the children. Please contact info@heshima.org.uk
