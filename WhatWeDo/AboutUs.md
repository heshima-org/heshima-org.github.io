# About Heshima

Heshima means Respect in Swahili and this underlies all that we do.

## Where is Heshima located and what are its aims?

Heshima is located near Kisongo, a rural village about 12km to the south of Arusha,
in Northern Tanzania. This village largely serves the Maasai Community. Sadly,
Maasai people often face discrimination and prejudice and find it difficult to get good
jobs. At Heshima, we hope to support these people by offering their children a good
start in school and life and by offering their mothers training and skills to enable them
to make an income and become more independent.

Heshima is based on a one-acre site and now features a house for the
caretaker/groundsman, a classroom for the pre-school, a large 2 story building
housing the textile project and shop and a computer laboratory, and toilets. On the
remaining land, some fruit trees have been planted, but still leaving a large grassy
space for the pre-school children to play on.

The project employs a caretaker/groundsman; a teacher in charge of the pre-school
and who also has oversight of the textile project; and a textile trainer.

The site generates electricity through solar panels, and is now also connected to the
mains. Under the main building is a large tank for the storage of rainwater.

Heshima is a registered charity in both the UK and Tanzania, and is listed on
Companies House in the UK.

## Pre-School

We have a preschool class in its own classroom. There are about 10 children aged
from 3 to 6, some of whose mothers are involved in the textile training project. The
children are able to engage in creative play. They sing songs, play games, listen to a
story and enjoy Art and Crafts. All the activities are carried out in English: this is
important as if they don’t have a basic understanding of English, they soon get left
behind at school and have no chance of being accepted into a secondary school.
There is a large play area equipped with swings, climbing frame, children’s bikes and
many other toys. The children also have access to interactive resources on lap-tops.
The children are provided with a nutritious meal during the morning.

## Saturday School

Class sizes in local schools are big. Many teachers try to teach classes of 70 or
more. Children have to share desks and chairs and there are few resources. In
association with Braeburn International School nearby, we can offer local primary
and secondary children individual help on a Saturday. We can listen to their reading;
help them with their Maths and spend some time developing a sport such as
basketball or swimming, and they can enjoy some art and craft activities. Saturday
school is making a difference and has helped many students to improve their
confidence and therefore their achievement in school. In the near future, it is hoped
to employ a teacher on the Heshima site who can operate an after-school homework
club.

## Textile Training

To make a lasting difference to the families that live around Heshima, a well-
equipped textile training centre has been operating for around 10 years. This is now
located in 2 rooms in our main building. A number of unemployed women come in
the afternoons to learn textile skills, including basics such as measuring and cutting
accurately. The trainer is a local lady who herself was trained by the project. The aim
is to enable the women to set up their own textile business in their own community
so that they have some financial independence. English classes are also provided,
using the lap-tops, which help them run their own successful businesses once they
have finished the training. In the mornings, some of the women who have finished
their training and have stayed on at Heshima make different textile products, which
are sold to provide them with an income and funding for Heshima. There is a small
shop on-site where tourists are able to see and purchase items. Items are also sold
in local tourist hotels and at an annual charity fair.

Some of the younger women have also formed themselves into a netball team, and
have participated in several matches with other women’s teams, thus breaking
gender stereotypes!

## Carpentry Project

In 2022, we started building a workshop to be able to teach woodworking skills to young 
men in the community to run alongside the textiles project. The building has been completed 
and we are currently fitting doors and windows, before setting it up as a workshop inside. 
We applied for a carpentry kit from Tools with a Mission (TWAM) and were accepted in early 2025. 
We expect these tools, which have been donated and reburbished in the UK, to arrive sometime in 2025.
We plan to run a 6-month beginners course to develop skills in using different handtools. 
It is hoped that we will then develop a range of products that can be sold at Heshima and online. 
The workshop consists of 2 rooms so in future, there is the possibility of our tranees returning 
to Heshima to make products to-order at the same time as another group are being trained.

## Volunteering with Heshima

We always need help at Heshima and thankfully people both old and young, from
around the world, volunteer to help out. Some volunteer for a couple of weeks, whilst
others commit to a longer period of time … but all are useful! We try to find out
where your strengths and interests lie and then we match you up with something you
feel comfortable with. These are some of the jobs that our volunteers have taken on:

- Organised activities for the mother and toddler group.
- Taught English to Maasai women.
- Supported students with reading at the Saturday School.
- Developed the Garden.
- Built an obstacle course for Children.
- Helped with the building and maintenance work including painting, carpentry,
  plumbing and electrics.
- Run art, music or drama workshops for local children.
- Coached football
- Assisted with training at the textile training centre, providing design ideas.
- Organised or participated in a sponsored event eg. climbing Kilimanjaro.
  Let us know what you are interested in and I am sure that we will be able to
  make the most of your skills and gifts.

## Cost of Volunteering

You will need to buy your return flight: the nearest airport is Kilimanjaro, about 90
minutes away. A taxi can be booked for you (approximately £30/$35 each way)
We can arrange accommodation for you on the Braeburn International School site,
which is around 5 km away from the Heshima site. Accommodation here is around
£10 a night for a room. Two people can stay together in one room. The room is basic
but clean and includes a mosquito net, and an ensuite shower room. In the courtyard
behind your room there is a shared kitchen and dining area, where you can cook
your meals.

There is an outdoor swimming pool, bar, basketball court and squash courts on the
school site, which all our volunteers can use.

You will be expected to be self-sufficient, and have the confidence to make your own
daily travel arrangements to/from the Heshima site by either dala-dala (local minibus)
or bicycle. Tanzania is generally very safe for visitors during daylight hours, but you
may feel more comfortable volunteering as a pair. Local people are generally very
friendly, and are delighted when visitors engage with them, for instance, at the local
market stalls. Language can be a problem: many people only have a smattering of
English, Swahili being the “official” language, so a willingness to learn a few phrases
in Swahili is always appreciated! Volunteers who are prepared to engage with the
locals will benefit much more from their visit.

Please remember that there is no National Health service in Tanzania and so all
volunteers need to come with medical insurance. The Tanzanian Government also
requires you to come with a yellow fever certificate and evidence of Covid
vaccination.

A tourist visa can be obtained on arrival at the airport ($50), but to avoid queuing, it
may be better to apply for the Visa online.

## Things to do and see

All volunteers need “time out” and there are many things to do and see in and
around Arusha: Arusha National Park is nearby as well as, further afield, Tarangire,
Manyara, Serengeti and Ngorogoro Parks. In addition there is Mt Meru (5000m),
towering above Arusha, and Kilimanjaro. But be warned: charges for visitors to all of
these are high! For a cheaper day out, the Monduli Hills (about 50p on the dala-dala)
are worth exploring, and there is also an organised walking group which meets on
Sundays. Other local attractions include the weekly Maasai Market in Kisongo, and
the maasai Craft Market in Arusha. For the more adventurous, there is Dar-es
Salaam, recently reconnected to Arusha by overnight train, and Zanzibar, both also
accessed by flights from the local Arusha airport.
