# About Heshima

Heshima means Respect in Swahili and this underlies all that we do.

## Where is Heshima located and what are its aims?

Heshima is located near Kisongo, a rural village about 12km to the south of Arusha,
in Northern Tanzania. This village largely serves the Maasai Community. Sadly,
Maasai people often face discrimination and prejudice and find it difficult to get good
jobs. At Heshima, we hope to support these people by offering their children a good
start in school and life and by offering their mothers training and skills to enable them
to make an income and become more independent.

Heshima is based on a one-acre site and now features a house for the
caretaker/groundsman, a classroom for the pre-school, a large 2 story building
housing the textile project and shop and a computer laboratory, and toilets. On the
remaining land, some fruit trees have been planted, but still leaving a large grassy
space for the pre-school children to play on.

The project employs a caretaker/groundsman; a teacher in charge of the pre-school
and who also has oversight of the textile project; and a textile trainer.

The site generates electricity through solar panels, and is now also connected to the
mains. Under the main building is a large tank for the storage of rainwater.

Heshima is a registered charity in both the UK and Tanzania, and is listed on
Companies House in the UK.

## Pre-School

We have a preschool class in its own classroom. There are about 10 children aged
from 3 to 6, some of whose mothers are involved in the textile training project. The
children are able to engage in creative play. They sing songs, play games, listen to a
story and enjoy Art and Crafts. All the activities are carried out in English: this is
important as if they don’t have a basic understanding of English, they soon get left
behind at school and have no chance of being accepted into a secondary school.
There is a large play area equipped with swings, climbing frame, children’s bikes and
many other toys. The children also have access to interactive resources on lap-tops.
The children are provided with a nutritious meal during the morning.

## Saturday School

Class sizes in local schools are big. Many teachers try to teach classes of 70
or more. Children have to share desks and chairs and there are few resources. We
can offer children more individual help on a Saturday. We can listen to their
reading; help them with their Maths and spend some time developing a sport such
as basketball or swimming. This supplements what they get in school and they are
able to ask for help with topics they do not understand. Saturday school is
making a difference and has helped many students to improve their confidence and
therefore their achievement in school.

## School Partnerships

Heshima continues to promote school partnerships. We know that links between
schools from different countries benefits everyone involved. We set up and
facilitate shared projects between schools and help to arrange school visits.
Part of these often involve summer school activites such as Drama, Music and
Art, subjects not normally taught in schools.

## Textile Training

To make a lasting difference to the families that live around Heshima, we have
started up a textile training centre. A range of unemployed women come in the
morning to learn a skill. We now have a trainer, who has already completed
training through Heshima. The training also involves some English classes, which
will help them run their own successful businesses once they have finished the
traiining. In the afternoons, some of the women who have now finished their
training with us are employed to make different textile products, which are sold
to help keep Heshima sustainable.

## Future Development

It’s nice to dream! So this is what we picture in the future:

- To complete the purpose built training centre that we have started building.
- Develop our children’s playground.
- Start a library for the children in the area.
- Start vocational training for the unemployed men in the area.
